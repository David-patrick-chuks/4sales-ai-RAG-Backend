Amina Yusuf, a renewable energy entrepreneur from ABU Zaria, runs SolarShed Energy in Kano. Her startup provides solar mini-grids and battery storage systems for rural schools and clinics across northern Nigeria.

The company operates from No. 8, Unity Close, Bompai, Kano State. Amina founded SolarShed in 2020, after completing a master's degree in sustainable energy in Germany.

Their top product is the "BrightPack" — a portable solar generator with USB ports, LED lamps, and a 50W solar panel. It is popular among students and traders in off-grid areas.

SolarShed partners with UNICEF to power rural maternity wards and runs a pay-as-you-go model via a mobile USSD platform coded in Python and hosted on AWS Lambda.

Her younger brother, Musa Yusuf, leads logistics and warehouse operations. Their biggest deployment so far powered 30 schools in Jigawa State.

The BrightPack costs ₦35,000, with financing options available. The company slogan is "Powering dreams, one ray at a time."

Amina regularly shares project updates on LinkedIn and organizes monthly demo sessions in local communities.

Challenges include high import tariffs and limited local manufacturing, but Amina remains focused on clean, inclusive energy solutions for underserved areas
